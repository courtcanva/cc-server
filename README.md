### Environment Variables

Add a file named `.env` at the root directory. Copy the .env code from Backend ENV ticket on notion(Get notion access permission from the development group) and paste it in .env. You can refer to the `.env.example` file in the directory and repo.

## Notion Board
We put our ticket board and other important information in the notion board. Please advise our BA to get access to it.

- Warning:heavy_exclamation_mark::cop:: <b>No one</b> was allowed to manipulate `main` branch <b>directly</b> in any way and for any reason. When you get a new ticket and plan to start your work, please <b>create a new branch</b> then start coding.
   You can create a pull request to make your work able to be reviewed and tested by team and get your code merged after getting enough approvals.<br>
- Branch Name Example: "feature/cc-0027-a-user-can-view-pro-full-court"
- Tutorial about branch management: [Link](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches)
- It is better to delete your branch after your pull request is approved and your branch have been merged into `main` branch.

# Semantic Commit Messages

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

## Example

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
